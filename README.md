# IoT Garden

**IoT Garden** is a web-based smart garden monitoring and control system that leverages sensor data to automate and improve plant care. It is built for users who want to make their gardening process more efficient using IoT technology.

## Project Overview

ðŸš€ This project helps users monitor key environmental metrics in their garden â€” such as soil moisture, temperature, and light intensity â€” and control devices like pumps automatically or remotely through a user interface.

## Technologies

The system is developed using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or optionally React.js if expanded)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MySQL (managed via XAMPP)
- **Microcontroller**: ESP32
- **Communication**: REST API or MQTT (optional)
- **Pattern**: Model-View-Controller (MVC)

## Database Setup

To prepare the database:

1. Open **XAMPP** and start the **MySQL** module.
2. Access **phpMyAdmin** in your browser (usually at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
3. Create a database named `iot_garden`.
4. Import the file `iot_garden_database.sql` located in the `server` directory.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quyhoang62/IOT_Garden.git
